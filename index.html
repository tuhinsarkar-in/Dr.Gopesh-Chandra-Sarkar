												<h3>1. Early Life & Education (1941-1970)</h3>
												<p>Born on January 1st, 1941, in a modest village in Pabna District (Betil) in Bengal, Dr. Gopesh Chandra Sarkar grew up with an insatiable curiosity for science and sprituality. He pursued higher education with dedication and completed his PhD in Botany in the 1970s, laying the foundation for a lifelong journey of learning.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>2. Academic & Teaching Career (1970–2003)</h3>
												<p>After earning his PhD, he began a long and respected teaching career, inspiring thousands of students over 30 years. He also had a keen interest in medical science - allopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy, naturopathy, etc... He retired in 2003, leaving a lasting impact through his clear thinking, honesty, and deep knowledge.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>3. RSS Worker & MP Candidate (2003–2010)</h3>
											<p>He was a dedicated member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He was invited to join in the 1980s because of his devotion towards Hindu philosophy, and research on spirituality. He was also the founder of the spiritual research organisation named <b>Sandhanichakra</b>.  He followed the RSS values of discipline, service, and nationalism. Over the years, he became the RSS President (Sanghachalak) of West Dinajpur District (WB). His commitment to public service led him into active politics, where he served as the BJP West Bengal State Vice-President. In 2009, he contested in the Lok Sabha election from the Raiganj constituency as a BJP candidate, campaigning passionately for his ideals and love for the nation, despite limited resources and support.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>4. Legacy & Final Milestones (2010–Present)</h3>
												<p>In his later years, Dr. Sarkar focused on securing his family’s future. He made sure both his sons were well-settled—sending Uttam Sarkar to Bangalore for higher studies and Goutam Sarkar to Kolkata for vocational training. He also supported their marriages: Goutam’s marriage to Priyanka in 2007, and Uttam’s marriage to Moumita in 2008.

													When his grandsons were born - Tuhin Sarkar in 2010 and Rishav Sarkar in 2012—his role as a guide in the family grew stronger. In April 2021, during the pandemic, he bought a new home and moved to Barasat near the Kolkata airport, selling his Raiganj property. When the family visited the Barasat home in December 2021, it felt like a major milestone—an 80-year-old opening a new chapter for himself and the next generation.

												<h2>Swami Somadhi Prakash Aranya, Maharaj</h2>
												
											</header>
											<p>Swami Samadhi Prakash Aranya Maharaj (1885–1985) was a renowned Sankhya-Yogi of Bengal, a highly educated, enlightened, and divine personality who achieved *Moksha* (Nirvana)—the highest goal of yoga-sadhana—in the middle part of his long lifespan of 101 years. He attained immense yogic and supernatural powers early in life, and through deep meditation, he reached a transcendental stage where he could recall his previous lives, thereby revealing and supporting the truth of the Hindu doctrine of rebirth (reincarnation). Following an accidental head injury that resulted in multiple skull fractures, he was admitted to a hospital where surgery and anaesthesia were deemed inevitable. However, he instructed the doctor to proceed without anaesthesia, and the operation was carried out accordingly while he remained completely calm and quiet throughout, astonishing the doctor, who declared him to be undoubtedly a powerful yogi with supernatural abilities. Most incredibly, his divine touch reportedly revived the dead bodies of a young girl and a baby. Beyond his yogic prowess, he was also a great writer, social reformer, and yoga researcher, participating in the Indian Science Congress Association’s conferences in Hyderabad (1937) and Kolkata (1938). He strongly opposed the evil practice of untouchability.

												<h2>World Famous Magician, P.C. Sorcar Jr.</h2>
												
											</header>
											<p>Dr. Sarkar had an indomitable and inherent curiosity and numerous queries, from his boyhood, about the miracles of the mysterious spiritual world and the supernatural powers claimed to have been achieved by yogis and tantrics. Through his parapsychological research organization, *Sandhani Chakra*, he aimed to unveil and assess the reality of these claims and reveal the truth behind them. To facilitate such research work, he felt the need to acquire proper knowledge of magic tricks in addition to the scientific expertise of the scholars in his Sandhani Team. Therefore, he came into contact with the world-famous magician "Jadu Samrat" P.C. Sorcar (Senior) in Kolkata, and being inspired and guided by the great P.C. Sorcar (Sr.), he learned basic magic tricks from the Indian Magic Institute, Kolkata—not to become a professional magician, but to conduct proper investigations into the claimed supernatural activities. Interestingly, his very name, G.C. Sarkar, seemed magical and, perhaps, required some knowledge of magic to truly be worthy of it.

							<h4>The survey clearly reveals that Dr. Sarkar possessed a wide range of interests beyond his professional excellence in academia. Alongside his scholarly achievements, he was deeply engaged in political, social, and cultural spheres. His passions spanned politics, music, magic, art, photography, boxing, driving, rifle shooting, spiritualism, etc. Dr. Sarkar truly defied the old saying, “Jack of all trades, master of none”. He was indeed a master of many pursuits and held a doctorate in science as well. It is with great humility and pride that I present this biography for his loved ones and admirers.
