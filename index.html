											<div class="content">
												<h3>1. Early Life & Education (1941-1970)</h3>
												<p>Born on January 1st, 1941, in a modest village in Pabna District in Bengal), Dr. Gopesh Chandra Sarkar grew up with an insatiable curiosity for science and sprituality. He pursued higher education with dedication and completed his PhD in Botany in the 1970s, laying the foundation for a lifelong journey of learning.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>2. Academic & Teaching Career (1970–2003)</h3>
												<p>After earning his PhD, he began a long and respected teaching career, inspiring thousands of students over 30 years. He also had a keen interest in medical science - allopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy, naturopathy, etc... He retired in 2003, leaving a lasting impact through his clear thinking, honesty, and deep knowledge.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>3. RSS Worker & MP Candidate (2003–2010)</h3>
											<p>He was a dedicated member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), he was invited to join in the 1980s because of his devotion towards Hindu philosophy, and research on spirituality. He was also the founder of the spiritual research organisation named <b>Sandhanichakra</b>.  He followed the RSS values of discipline, service, and nationalism. Over the years, he became the RSS President (Sanghachalak) of West Dinajpur District (WB). His commitment to public service led him into active politics, where he served as the BJP West Bengal State Vice-President. In 2009, he contested in the Lok Sabha election from the Raiganj constituency as a BJP candidate, campaigning passionately for his ideals and love for the nation, despite limited resources and support.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>4. Legacy & Final Milestones (2010–Present)</h3>
												<p>In his later years, Dr. Sarkar focused on securing his family’s future. He made sure both his sons were well-settled—sending Uttam to Bangalore for higher studies and Goutam to Kolkata for vocational training. He also supported their marriages: Goutam’s marriage to Priyanka in 2007, and Uttam’s marriage to Moumita in 2008.

													When his grandsons were born—Tuhin in 2010 and Rishav in 2012—his role as a guide in the family grew stronger. In 2020, during the pandemic, he bought a new home and moved to Barasat near the airport, selling his Raiganj property. When the family visited the Barasat home in December 2021, it felt like a major milestone—an 80-year-old opening a new chapter for himself and the next generation.

				<p>Hey, I’m <a href = "https://www.tuhinsarkar.in">Tuhin Sarkar</a>.
					I made this site to tell the story of my grandfather—someone who shaped who I am in more ways than one. But since I’m the one who put this all together, it only makes sense I introduce myself too.
					<br>
					I’m a student, a self-taught developer, and someone who’s obsessed with making things that matter—apps, websites, ideas. I’m into cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, digital rights, and preserving and making history open for all to read.
					<br>
					Thanks for visiting. I hope you learn something new about my grandfather here—and maybe even something about where the next generation is headed.</p>
