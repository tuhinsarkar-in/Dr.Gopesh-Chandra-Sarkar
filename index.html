												<h3>1. Early Life & Education (1941-1970)</h3>
												<p>Born on January 1st, 1941, in a modest village in Pabna District (Betil) in Bengal, Dr. Gopesh Chandra Sarkar grew up with an insatiable curiosity for science and spirituality. He pursued higher education with dedication and completed his PhD in Botany in the 1970s, laying the foundation for a lifelong journey of learning.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>2. Academic & Teaching Career (1970–2003)</h3>
												<p>After earning his PhD, he began a long and respected teaching career at University College (North Bengal University, Raiganj), inspiring thousands of students over 30 years. He also had a keen interest in medical science - allopathy, ayurveda, homoeopathy, naturopathy, etc... He retired in 2003, leaving a lasting impact through his clear thinking, honesty, and deep knowledge.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>3. RSS Worker & MP Candidate (2003–2010)</h3>
											<p>He <strong>is</strong> a dedicated member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He was invited to join RSS in the 1980s because of his devotion towards Hindu philosophy and research on spirituality. He was also the founder of the spiritual research organisation named <b>Sandhanichakra</b>. He <strong>follows</strong> the RSS values of discipline, service, and nationalism. Over the years, he became the RSS President (Sanghachalak) of West Dinajpur District (WB). His commitment to public service led him into active politics, where he served as the BJP West Bengal State Vice-President. In 2009, he contested in the Lok Sabha election from the Raiganj constituency as a BJP candidate, campaigning passionately for his ideals and love for the nation, despite limited resources and support.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>4. Legacy & Final Milestones (2010–Present)</h3>
												<p>In recent years, Dr. Sarkar <strong>focuses</strong> on his family and <strong>continues to be</strong> a guiding presence. He made sure both his sons were well-settled, sending Uttam Sarkar to Bangalore for higher studies and Goutam Sarkar to Kolkata for vocational training. He also supported their marriages: Goutam’s marriage to Priyanka in 2007, and Uttam’s marriage to Moumita in 2008.

													With the birth of his grandsons - Tuhin Sarkar in 2010 and Rishav Sarkar in 2012—his role as a guide in the family <strong>is</strong> strong. In December 2020, during the pandemic, he bought a new home and moved to Barasat on 7th April 2021, near the Kolkata airport, after selling his Raiganj property. The family's visit to the Barasat home in December 2021 marked a significant milestone, reflecting an 80-year-old embarking on a new chapter for himself and the next generation.
