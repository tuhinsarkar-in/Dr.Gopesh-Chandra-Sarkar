    <h3>Art (Paintings)</h3>
    <p>This is a picture of Rabindranath Tagore. Dr. Gopesh, who was not only a master of science but also a true artist at heart, had unmatched creativity in art. The world around him seemed to be his canvas. The brush strokes in his hands brought to life the very essence of the world, as if the scenery itself whispered stories in colors that only he could translate. Every sunrise was painted with its own hues, every shadow had a shape only his mind could capture, and every fleeting moment in nature was transformed into a work of art.</p>
